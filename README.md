The CVR is a Customized "Vehicle history Report listing". It is essentially a small database that stores vehicle history reports. The Keys of the CVR are Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) and are strings composed of 10-17 alphanumeric characters. This project makes use of several data structures like hashtables, hashmaps, sequences, and trees.
